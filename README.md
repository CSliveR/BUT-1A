# First Year Computer Science Bachelor Repository

## Description
This repository gathers all the content stored on my computer related to my first year of the Computer Science Bachelor program at the IUT2 of Grenoble.

## Repository content
The content of this repository is organized by resources, which correspond to the different subjects (modules) taught during the first year.

### About resource naming

The names of the folders follow the naming conventions used in the French university system for this program:

- Resources starting with `R` refer to **theoretical or practical modules**.
- Resources starting with `S` refer to **SAEs**, which are *“Situations d’Apprentissage et d’Évaluation”* (Learning and Assessment Situations), i.e., larger projects or practical cases combining multiple skills.

The number before the dot indicates the **semester number**, and the number after the dot is the **identifier of the resource or SAE** within that semester.

For example:
- `R1.01` refers to resource 01 of semester 1.
- `S2.04` refers to SAE 04 of semester 2.
